# CodeSpecJS
Welcome to the CodeSpecJS. A Protractor and Cucumber.JS based framework that allow users to write UI Automation Tests without writing a single line of code. 

Gherkin grammar is very popular among many BDD frameworks. CodeSpecJS is targeting to take it to the next level by eliminating the need to write code associated with the Gherkin grammar. 

## Key Feature
* Zero code UI Test Automation. I.e. You will not write a single line of code to define your tests. you will be using a set of well defined Gherkin grammar to define your tests. Having no code to write provide some unique advantages
    * Learning curve to implement UI Automation tests is minimized.
    * Not depended on any specific programing language. CodeSpecJS grammar is written in pure english. Any one can understand it. 
    * No need to maintain test code bases, because with CodeSpecJS, there's none. 
    * Time taken to write tests are reduced drastically. 
    * No need to worry about inner workings of underline frameworks, As developers/testers, we just need to concentrate about test logic.
    * Real quick startup time. You can write your first UI Automation test within minutes
    
* Since all test are using Gherkin to define them, they are easy to write and well understood by all parties (i.e. stake holders, developers, testers etc.)
* You will be able to map real agile story definitions directly to CodeSpecJS tests since both use almost the same specification structure
* Provide grammar to support for all the necessary UI Automation Actions

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Setting up the development environment

1. You need to install [ NodeJs with NPM ](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll also need to install and configure [ Git ](https://git-scm.com/). 
2. Latest version of Chrome

### Step 2: Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/99xt/CodeSpecJS.git
```
### Step 3: Install node packages
Step inside the project root folder and issue the following command to install node dependencies.
```
npm install
```

### Step 4: Let's start writing our first UI Automation test 
Under the "features" folder create a new file called "sample.feature". copy and paste the specification given below
```
Feature: As a user I want to test http://automationpractice.com so that I can search for t-shirts and blouses
    Scenario: Search for t-shirt
        Given Navigate to "http://automationpractice.com"
        And Wait for "Main search bar" with the "id" of "search_query_top" to appear
        Then I enter "t-shirt" to the "Main search bar"
        And Click on "Search Button" with the "xpath" of "id('searchbox')/button"
        And Wait for "First Result Element" with the "xpath" of "id('center_column')/ul/li/div/div[2]/h5/a" to contain text "Faded Short Sleeve T-shirts"
         
    Scenario: Search for blouse
        Given Navigate to "http://automationpractice.com"
        And Wait for "Main search bar" to appear
        Then I enter "Blouse" to the "Main search bar"
        And Click on "Search Button"
        And Wait for "First Result Element" to contain text "Blouse"
```
* The first scenario "Search for t-shirt" is using what we call the CodeSpecJS Detailed Grammar (Ex: And Wait for "Main search bar" with the "id" of "search_query_top" to appear). Here, we are instructing CodeSpecJS to look for an UI element in the DOM model with an "id" value of "search_query_top" and to add it to the system object repository with a unique identifier "Search for t-shirt". 
* Once we specify a page object using the detailed grammar, we can refer to it directly using the element key (or the unique identifier) for all the future tests. 
* Note that detailed grammar is only necessary if you don't specify the page objects using an object repository. [Click here](https://github.com/99xt/CodeSpecJS/wiki/Creating-an-Object-Repository) to know more about how to create object repositories. 
* This is a standard [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) feature specification file.
* We are using CodeSpecJS pre-defined grammar to write the test above. A full set of Supported grammar with detail description can be found [here](https://github.com/99xt/CodeSpecJS/wiki/CodeSpecJS-Supported-Grammar)

Thats it, you are now ready to run the test. **Note that we haven't written any code** We just used a set of well defined Gherkin grammar to specify what we want to do. Please refer to [Supported Grammar](https://github.com/99xt/CodeSpecJS/wiki/CodeSpecJS-Supported-Grammar) to a full set of grammar you can use in your tests. 

### Step 5: Running the test
Inside the project root folder, issue the following command
```
npm run test
```
**Note that first time execution may take few minutes since system need to download browser drivers and configure them**
You should see your test executed in Chrome browser, Results will be shown in your console log. A detailed HTML report is generated under
\<project_root\>/results/reports. Open the html report and see the detailed results.
